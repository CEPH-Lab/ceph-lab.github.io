### Getting to the Lab

**Finding Our Building**
Please note that while we are part of the School of Public Health (main building located at *1025 E 7th St*), our lab is located specifically in the **SPH Annex**. The Annex is situated just across the street at **309 N Woodlawn Ave**, near the intersection of 7th Street and Woodlawn Avenue. 

**Public Transit & Biking**
* **Bus:** The lab is easily accessible via **Bloomington Transit** and the IU Campus Bus system. Several routes drop off near the Indiana Memorial Union (IMU). You can check the current [Bloomington Transit schedules](https://bloomingtontransit.com/) or the IU Mobile app for routes serving the 7th & Woodlawn area.
* **Bicycle:** If you are cycling to campus, there are bike racks conveniently located directly behind our lab building.

**Parking Information**
* **Visitor Parking:** The most convenient visitor parking is available at the Indiana Memorial Union (IMU) Pay Lot, located just a short walk south of the lab on Woodlawn Avenue. 
* **Campus Permits:** If you hold an IU parking permit, please consult the interactive [IU Campus Map](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=951) for the nearest applicable EM or CH permit lots.
* **Street Parking:** Please note that metered street parking is generally located off-campus closer to downtown Bloomington, which will require a longer walk to the lab.
